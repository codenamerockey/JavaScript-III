/* The for principles of "this";
 * in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
 *
 * 1. The This key word used in the global context results in the window object being referenced, since that is the object it is in at the time.
 * 2. The implicit approach means that based on how you use the 'this' keyword the javascript engine will automatically decide how it is referenced meaning if used with a method 'this' will refer to the object that has defined that method.
 * 3. When the new keyword is used the 'this' keyword behaves in a specific way automatically based on use of the new keyword. The new keyword automatically causes it to be bound to the new constructor it is creating.
 * 4. Explicit binding of the 'this' keyword just means you as the developer pick where you want the 'this' keyword to point to, specifically what object you want it to reference.
 *
 * write out a code example of each explanation above
